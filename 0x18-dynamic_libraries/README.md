Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are a type of code library that can be loaded and linked to a program at runtime rather than at compile time. Unlike static libraries, which are linked to a program during the compilation process, dynamic libraries remain separate from the executable and are loaded into memory when needed.

Here are some key points about dynamic libraries:

Runtime Linking: Dynamic libraries are linked to a program at runtime, which means that the linking process occurs when the program is executed, not during the compilation phase. This allows for more flexibility and modularity in software development.

Code Sharing: Multiple programs can use the same dynamic library, promoting code reuse and saving disk space. This is because the library is loaded into memory once and shared among multiple processes.

Updates and Maintenance: If a dynamic library is updated or patched, all programs using that library can benefit from the changes without requiring recompilation of each individual program. This makes maintenance and updates more efficient.

Reduced Memory Usage: Since dynamic libraries are shared among multiple processes, they contribute to a more efficient use of memory. The library code is loaded into memory once and shared among all the programs using it, reducing overall memory usage.

DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) in Windows, .so files in Unix-like Systems: On Windows, dynamic libraries are often referred to as DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries), while on Unix-like systems (including Linux), they are typically represented as .so files (Shared Objects).

Dynamically Loaded Libraries: The process of loading dynamic libraries at runtime is known as dynamic loading. Programs can explicitly load and use dynamic libraries based on specific conditions or user interactions.

In summary, dynamic libraries provide a way for programs to share code at runtime, promoting code reuse, modularity, and efficient memory usage. They offer advantages in terms of flexibility, maintenance, and updates compared to static libraries.
